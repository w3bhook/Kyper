# Kyper
A multi purpose password managing and generating tool called Kyper.

# Setup
The setup for Kyper is fairly simple only involving the command <code>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code> (which installs the required dependencies for you)
as well as, <code>python main.py</code>, after you have ran this, you should be on the path for the password manager to be starting as a <b>CLI</b> application, keep in mind the questions are not part of the actual package and that this software is fully mutable, but other than that, you will be met with a few questions inquiring you on the details the software needs to generate a password.
